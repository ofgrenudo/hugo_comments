# Hugo Comments

You may or may not know, but I run a blog.

![dun dun dunnnnn!](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNTFneWE4dmZ2cnRuajRhb2VnNHJsYWduMmxhang3MTh3YnBsdXplMyZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/wByNadN7cMyGpopf1r/giphy.gif)

That being said, I like to hear what people on the internet have to say (generally). Most people are crazy, and all people on the internet are right, and you're wrong (this includes me.. the being right part..). Unfortunately though, I moved my blog from a CMS to hugo, which is a static site generate. And when reviewing the options that are provided for comments. I just kind of dont like them, They all require you to create an account, or host the comment system with someone. To me that makes the whole point of using hugo kind of moot. Why would I not, self host the comment infrasturcutre? Why can the comment infrastructure not live in a docker container? Why can my site, and my comment infrastructure live in a docker compose file? Why?

Well, I hope to work on this project to anwser those questions, and build my own solution. Eventually, this project will get mature enough, and others can use it as well.
